IOException :
         Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred. 
         This class is the general class of  exceptions produced by
          failed or interrupted I/O operations.
		  
		  => import java.io.IOException
		  
SQLException :
              SQLException occurs if there is an error in the database access or
 other errors related to the database. 
 
		=>import java.sql.SQLException
 
 
CLassNotFOund Exception :
                ClassNotFoundException is a checked exception in Java that occurs when the 
                JVM tries to load a particular class  but does not find it in the classpath
                        (OR)
               This Exception is raised when we try to access a class whose definition is not found.

				=> no need to Import , inside java.lang.ClassNotFoundException 
				
				//  no need to import any runtime exectpions ,because they are in lang package

Arithmetic exception : 
              It is thrown when an exceptional condition has occurred in an arithmetic operation.
			  
				=> no need to Import , inside java.lang.ArithmeticException
				
NullPointerException : 
              This exception is raised when referring to the members of a null object.
              Null represents nothing
			  
			  => no need to Import , inside java.lang.NullPointerException
			  
			  
NumberFormatException : 
                     This exception is raised when a method could not convert a 
                         string into a numeric format.
						 
			 => no need to Import , inside java.lang.NumberFormatException 
			 
ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception : 
                  It is thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. 
                  The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.
				  
			=> no need to Import , inside java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

StringIndexOutOfBoundsException : 
                  It is thrown by String class methods to 
                  indicate that an index is either negative than the size of the string.
				  
			=> no need to Import , inside java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
			
			
			
			//  no need to import these errors ,becoz  virtual machine error is  in lang package
			// InternalError, OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, UnknownError
			//these errors are subclasses of Virtual Machine Error

Stack Over FLow Error : 
                     A StackOverflowError is a runtime error in Java. 
                     It is thrown when the amount of call stack memory allocated by the JVM 
                     is exceeded.  A common case of a StackOverflowError being thrown, 
                     is when the call stack exceeds due to excessive deep or infinite recursion.
					 
Virtual Machine Error  :
           VirtualMachineError is thrown when the Java virtual machine encounters an 
           internal error or resource limitation, which prevents it from functioning. 

          It's a self-defensive mechanism employed by JVM to 
          prevent the entire application from crashing.
		  
Out of Memory Error :
             OutOfMemoryError is a runtime error in Java which occurs when the Java Virtual Machine 
             (JVM) is unable to allocate an object due to insufficient space in the Java heap. 

             This error can also be thrown  when the native memory is insufficient 
             to support the loading of a Java class.
